This script fetches the latest 15 added feeds and checks, if this podcast is somewhat new. New in this case means: less then 10 episodes (no check for age atm). If so, it adds the first episode to a curation. 

I use this script to fill the curation "Nullnummern" (or "Podcasts' Pilots").

Don't forget to fetch your accesstoken (https://fyyd.de/dev/app). It won't work without!
